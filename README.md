## Pay close attention to comments in student files
Usually an error would pop up when a a file or comment is improperly formatted but here are some examples to be on the lookout

1. Cannot handle improperly handled file names (e.g Lab4, llab4, etc...)
1. Cannot handle improperly formatted comments since it splits comments based on a ":" separator value (e.g Class :-, Student: ID:, Student ID: xxx-yyy-zzz)
